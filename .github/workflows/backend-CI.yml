name: Backend CI

# This workflow runs the unit tests and integration tests for the backend.
# Integration tests use real SQL database, but fortunately windows-latest
# image contains support for SQL Express localDb.
# This approach is significantly simpler than running it via docker-compose,
# although, yes, it's more prone to breaking, since it's not isolated.
